This is the Mooltipass production folder. The Mooltipass is composed of the following elements:

1) Bottom PCB (see gerbers_bottom folder):
Depending on the case version (thick or slim: Arduino or Non-Arduino compatible) the connectors P1/P2/P3/P4 are populated or not.
In case of the thick Arduino compatible version, the P3 & P4 connector pins must be less than 1.6mm long due to the smartcard connector placed on the other side of the PCB.

2) Top PCB (see gerbers_top folder):
This is a PCB containing the capacitive touch wheel, on which should be put the 35mm diameter double sided tape (see 3).
Its soldermask should be black, and the back of the PCB must be machined (1.2mm deep) following the path shown in the pcb_milling folder.

3) A 35mm diameter double sided tape:
This small double sided tape must be put on the top PCB touch wheel footprint to guarantee a good contact with the front panel (see 4)

4) A semi transparent front panel (see serigraphy folder):
This is the front panel put on top of the assembly.
It is 1mm thick, black at some places and lightly tinted (20-25%) at others.

5) A plastic or aluminium main case (see case folder):
This is the main case where the two PCBs and OLED screen will be put.

6) A 3.12" Light Blue Monochrome OLED display
