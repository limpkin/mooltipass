I) Example on a debian based distribution

a) clone this repository

b) add the udev rule (or run the remaining of this tutorial as sudo): https://www.themooltipass.com/udev_rule.txt

c) in your favorite terminal:
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-crypto
- navigate to this very directory
- sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

d) generating and uploading your bundle
- connect your mooltipass mini
- insert a mooltipass mini card backwards
- run: python mooltipass_tool.py packSignUpload ../../bitmaps/mini/bundle.img  ../../source_code/Release/Mooltipass.hex (or the path to your firmware) <your_aes_key1> <uploading_password>
- approve the prompt on the device, DO NOT DISCONNECT THE MOOLTIPASS WHEN THE SCREEN IS OFF. Wait 5 minutes.

II) Required informations
a) AES key 1: will be sent to you in person through a secured and authenticated communication channel. The Mooltipass Team declines all responsibility for loss of data or damaged unit once this key is sent to the customer.
b) Uploading Password: the password is current_firmware_version (as a string, for example "v1.2") concatenated with the device UID key (which is 6 bytes long). This string is then encrypted using the device AES key 2. For example on how to generate the uploading password, please check out generateBundlePasswordUpload() in mooltipass_security_check.py . For information, this password is just meant as a way to protect against DoS.
