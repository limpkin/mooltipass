Entropy = 7.787095 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11619 byte file by 2 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11619 samples is 6567.22, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 110.0003 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.392561983 (error 7.99 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.098324 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
